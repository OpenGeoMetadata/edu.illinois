Shorelines, defined as the wet/dry line, were digitized at 1:250 scale from modern aerial orthomosaics at four study sites at Illinois Beach State Park between 2018 and 2021 as part of an effort to monitor coastal change. The aerial images were collected using an unoccupied aerial system (UAS) flown at Illinois Beach State Park under contract with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources Coastal Management Program.     Data are georeferenced to NAD83(1986) UTM Zone 16 North meters. All activities were conducted in adherence to Federal Aviation Administration regulations, permitted by the Illinois Natures Preserve Commissions and the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.",

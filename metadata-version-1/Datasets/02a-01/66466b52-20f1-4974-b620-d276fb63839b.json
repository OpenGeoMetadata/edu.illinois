We have used existing local work to compile regional maps that provide a broader context for research on the tectonics of the Midcontinent (OIINK web site: http://www.indiana.edu/~oiink/).  This map series was originally conceived as a means to provide visual context for discussions associated with an NSF EarthScope Workshop on Tectonic Targets for EarthScope in the Midcontinent (S. Marshak, lead convener) that was held on April 11-13, 2010 in Urbana, Illinois. The maps are available from the Illinois State Geological Survey.  These Esri layer packages (ArcGIS v. 10.x) are being provided as-is and represent the GIS data as downloaded or digitized from the various source materials.",

  "dc_description_s": "This dataset consists of modified FEMA-grade LiDAR point cloud data for the Mississippi River floodplain in Navigation Pools 8 through 24. The data was collected between the dates of 11/7/2007 and 12/8/2011. The program spanned multiple years and the dynamic nature of the floodplain will likely create surface inconsistencies caused by these temporal differences between flightlines of different dates. Please be aware of these differences while analyzing the data. Wilson & Company and Sanborn Map Company combined to complete acquisition and processing of the LiDAR data.",

The data table includes information on the location of the borehole, log type, location uncertainty, file locations and remarks. Citations are included in the dataset. The WellBoreURI for a particular feature is the cross-referencing link (foreign key) used to associate the feature with other web based information. Layer files containing the symbology for these data layers can be found in the AASG repository at http://repository.stategeothermaldata.org/repository/resource/98ddf901b9782a25982e01af3b068fdc/. The original data and metadata can be viewed or downloaded from the AASG repository at http://repository.stategeothermaldata.org/repository/resource/98ddf901b9782a25982e01af3b12c35b/ or from the National Geothermal Data System website at http://search.geothermaldata.org/dataset/illinois-well-logs.",

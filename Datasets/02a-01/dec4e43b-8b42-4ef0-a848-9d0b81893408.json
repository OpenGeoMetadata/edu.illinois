These are Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) with a NAD83 datum, Zone 16 and Illinois State Plane East Zone (SPE) with a NAD83 datum. Data were created using US Geological Survey Urban Area specifications on true-color film during the leaf-off period of spring, 2005 at a 1 foot by 1 foot resolution. Each data tile was created utilizing multiple aerial images. Images were captured on the following dates in 2005: March 28, April 4, April 8, April 14, and May 4. Programmatic details for CUA data were outlined in Illinois GIS Notes, Winter 2005.",

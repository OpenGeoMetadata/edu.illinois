  "dc_description_s": "Airborne transient electromagnetic (TEM) method was used along the southwest shore of Lake Michigan to map thickness and distribution of the unconsolidated sand covering the beach and the near shore area (up to 1 km into the lake).  From Kenosha, WI to the Illinois-Indiana border, a total of 1049 line-km of TEM data were acquired.  Sand distribution and thickness was estimated from conversion of the resistivity values from TEM data into lithology.  Through resistivity to lithology conversion, we were also able to estimate thickness and distribution of clay (glacial sediments) and dolomite (bedrock) under the lake bed.  A brief description of the comparison of geophysical results to lithology is provided in:  Mwakanyamale, K.E., Brown, S.E., & Theuerkauf, E.J. (2020).  Delineating spatial distribution and thickness of unconsolidated sand along the southwest Lake Michigan shoreline using TEM and ERT geophysical methods, Journal of Great Lakes Research, 46(6), 1544-1330, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jglr.2020.08.002.  This project was funded by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Coastal Management Program as a part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Office of Coastal Management, Projects of Special Merit Award Competition, Award No. NA16NOS4190151.",

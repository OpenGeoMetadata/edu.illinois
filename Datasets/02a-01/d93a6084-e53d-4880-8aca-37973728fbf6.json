LiDAR acquisition and processing to the Point Cloud product took place during the 2010 fall flight season. See MIP Case 11-05-2218S for further information and documentation. Processing to the fully classified dataset took place under the FY11 tasking. The deliverable consists of tiles of fully classified LAS 1.2 points. A narrative accompanies this deliverable, as well as the independent QC report, and a QA report.",

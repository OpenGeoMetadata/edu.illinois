Nearly 70,000 pages in 170 volumes covering Illinois and nearby states are available digitally. In addition, precise locations from each page have been entered into a database so that notes can be discovered and viewed spatially using GIS. There are about 100,000 location references (about 75,000 distinct locations).",

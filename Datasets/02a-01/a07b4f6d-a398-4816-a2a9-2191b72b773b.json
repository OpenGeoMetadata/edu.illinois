  "dc_description_s": "Because the Illinois 2007 CDL is a marked departure from previous NASS CDL data products, remote sensing scientists from the Illinois State Geological Survey, the Illinois Natural History Survey, and USDA NASS conducted a formal accuracy assessment of the Illinois 2007 CDL land cover data product. The results of the statistical analyses are contained in the project report (see below).Â  The statistical analysis determined that certain land cover categories from the original Illinois 2007 NASS CDL data product should be aggregated. ISGS and INHS scientists created a revised version of the CDL data product and also applied a color-coding scheme similar to that for the 1999-2000 Illinois Land Cover data product.",
